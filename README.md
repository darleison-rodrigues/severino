Severino Command-Line Interface
This document delineates the operational parameters and structural composition of the Severino Command-Line Interface (CLI), an instrumental utility engineered to facilitate diverse computational tasks through the judicious application of both localized Large Language Models (LLMs) and cloud-based LLM Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The overarching objective of this apparatus is to furnish expeditious, on-premise inferential capabilities for routine computational demands, leveraging the Gemma model, concurrently providing access to high-fidelity, intricate generative functionalities via the Gemini API, with an integrated mechanism for fiscal oversight.

Salient Features
Local Gemma Inference: The system is endowed with the capacity to execute inferential processes utilizing Gemma models directly upon the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) of the host system, thereby ensuring rapid, private, and unremunerated computational operations.

Gemini API Integration: Access to the robust Gemini API is afforded for the purpose of advanced content generation, complemented by configurable alerts pertaining to potential financial expenditures.

Modular Architectural Design: The underlying architecture is characterized by a modular composition, which significantly enhances the facility of extension and the efficacy of maintenance protocols.

Implementation Procedure
The following sequential steps are requisite for the successful deployment of this project:

Repository Acquisition:
The source code repository is to be cloned from its designated Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and the working directory subsequently altered to the newly created project root.

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/severino.git # The placeholder URL is to be substituted with the actual repository URL.
cd severino

Python Virtual Environment Establishment:
A dedicated Python virtual environment is to be instantiated, followed by its activation to ensure isolation of project dependencies.

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # For Microsoft Windows operating systems, the command is .venv\Scripts\activate.

Dependency Installation:
All requisite software dependencies, as enumerated within the requirements.txt file, are to be installed.

pip install -r requirements.txt

GPU (CUDA) Prerequisite: It is imperative that the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit be installed upon the host system to enable llama-cpp-python[cuda] to harness the computational capabilities of the GPU. Consultation of NVIDIA's official documentation for installation guidelines is advised.

Gemma Model Procurement:
A Gemma GGUF model, specifically gemma-7b-it.Q4_K_M.gguf or an equivalent quantized variant, is to be downloaded from a recognized repository on Hugging Face (e.g., TheBloke/Gemma-7B-it-GGUF or unsloth/gemma-3-7b-it-GGUF). The acquired .gguf file must then be deposited within the severino/data/models/ directory.

Gemini API Key Configuration:
A Gemini API key is to be procured from Google AI Studio. Subsequently, a file designated .env is to be created within the root directory of severino/, into which the aforementioned API key is to be inscribed.

GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

Crucial Directive: The .env file must, under no circumstances, be committed to version control. Its inclusion in .gitignore serves to enforce this directive.

Operational Directives
Command execution is performed by invoking python src/main.py <command> [arguments].

Local Gemma Inference
To initiate local inferential processes utilizing the Gemma model, the following command syntax is employed:

python src/main.py gemma "Write a short Python function for quicksort."
python src/main.py gemma "Explain the concept of recursion." --max-tokens 100 --temperature 0.5

Gemini API Generation
For the generation of content via the Gemini API, the subsequent command structure is utilized:

python src/main.py gemini "Draft a compelling marketing email for a new productivity app."
python src/main.py gemini "Summarize the key findings from the latest climate change report." --max-tokens 2000
