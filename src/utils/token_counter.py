# This file is intended for utilities related to token counting.
# While the `google-generativeai` library provides `model.count_tokens()`,
# you might need custom tokenizers or estimation for other models or specific use cases.

# For local LLMs, token counting might be handled by the model's library or require a custom tokenizer.

# Example of a very basic, approximate token counter (not for production LLM use):
def simple_word_token_estimate(text: str) -> int:
    """
    Provides a very rough estimate of tokens based on word count.
    This is NOT accurate for LLMs and should only be used for conceptual understanding.
    LLM tokenization is complex and depends on the specific tokenizer.
    """
    return len(text.split())

# If you were to integrate other local LLMs that don't have built-in token counting
# or if you needed a universal approximate counter for display purposes,
# you might add more sophisticated (but still approximate) logic here.
