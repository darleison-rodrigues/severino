# Overview

Severino is an advanced AI agent designed to operate within the Gemini CLI framework. Its primary purpose is to provide intelligent assistance for ML monitoring, software engineering tasks, and system management. Severino leverages both local (Gemma) and cloud-based (Gemini) AI capabilities to offer a comprehensive solution for developers and system administrators.

## Vision

Severino aims to enable "Intelligent Edge AI" and "Confidential AI" solutions. This involves bridging local edge devices, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, with scalable and secure cloud services provided by Cloudflare Workers and Azure Confidential VMs.

## Core Principles

*   **Developer-Centric:** Designed to enhance productivity and provide deep insights into complex ML systems.
