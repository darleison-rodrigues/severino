It focuses on executing complex tasks through intelligent tool chaining, providing real-time insights into ML systems, and offering a seamless, performant user experience.

## Core Principles

*   **Command-Centric Intelligence:** Interprets natural language into precise tool commands, understanding context and proactively suggesting or executing efficient toolchains.
*   **Targeted Multimodal Access:** Provides lightweight, performant UI elements for specific interactions like voice input (`severino listen`).
*   **Cognitive ML Monitoring:** Leverages cognitive architecture principles to ingest monitoring data and provide human-readable, actionable insights and recommendations.
*   **Lightweight & Performant:** Prioritizes local Gemma inference and ephemeral UI elements for minimal resource consumption and responsiveness.
*   **Developer-Centric:** Designed to enhance productivity and provide deep insights into complex ML systems.
*   **Intelligent Automation:** Automates complex workflows and provides proactive assistance.
*   **Security First:** Prioritizes secure operations and data handling.
*   **Privacy-Centric:** Adheres to privacy principles, especially when dealing with sensitive data.
*   **Extensible:** Built with a modular architecture to allow for easy integration of new tools and capabilities.
*   **User Control:** Ensures users have explicit control over sensitive operations and resource usage.
