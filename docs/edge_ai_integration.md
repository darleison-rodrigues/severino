# Edge AI Integration

Severino is designed to seamlessly integrate with and manage Edge AI devices, particularly focusing on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX for real-time monitoring and local data processing. This integration enables Severino to act as a central control point for distributed AI systems.

## Core Edge AI Pipeline (Balcony Safety System Example)

Severino can interact with edge devices to manage complex AI pipelines, such as the conceptual Balcony Safety AI Monitoring System.

### Data Flow and Processing:

*   **Raw Camera Feeds:** Ingested directly on the Jetson.
*   **Object Detection:** Processed by models like YOLOv8 to identify objects (e.g., children).
*   **Child Classification:** Further analysis to distinguish children from adults using fine-tuned models or techniques (e.g., height-based estimation, posture analysis).

### Zone Definition System:

*   **Local Configuration:** Danger zones are configured and stored directly on the edge device.
*   **API/Interface:** An API or interface allows for defining polygon-based zones and activating time-based restrictions, which Severino can remotely manage.

## Alert Management and Local Response

Severino facilitates robust alert management and local responses on the edge device.

### Alert Management System:

*   **Triggering:** Different alert levels (warning, critical, emergency) are triggered based on detected events.
*   **Escalation Logic:** A state machine or logic flow manages the escalation of alerts.
*   **Local Audio Warnings:** Integration with systems like ESP32 for multi-language audio warnings.
*   **False Trigger Avoidance:** Mechanisms (e.g., sound detection) are in place to minimize false audio triggers.

## Edge-to-Cloud Integration and Data Pipeline

Severino enables secure and efficient data transmission from edge devices to cloud services.

### Data Pipeline:

*   **Secure Transmission:** Data (alerts, metrics, raw data streams) is securely transferred from the Jetson to Cloudflare R2 Storage.
*   **Encryption:** Data is encrypted during transmission to ensure privacy and integrity.
*   **Frequency:** Configurable frequency of data uploads.
*   **Cloud ML for Optimization:** Historical patterns can be recognized and false positives reduced through cloud-based machine learning.

### Video Analysis Worker (Cloudflare Workers AI):

*   **Frame Reception:** Receives frames from the edge device.
*   **Advanced Scene Understanding:** Utilizes Cloudflare Workers AI models (e.g., `@cf/microsoft/resnet-50`) for complex scene analysis.
*   **Behavioral Analysis:** Conducts analysis to detect specific risky behaviors (e.g., climbing, leaning, object throwing).

## Advanced Edge Features and Resilience

Severino's integration extends to managing advanced features and ensuring the resilience of edge deployments.

### Behavioral Analysis Engine:

*   **Risk Detection:** Detects specific risky behaviors and escalates risk based on duration.
*   **Machine Learning Enhancements:** Employs ML techniques for continuous learning and personalized models.

### Backup Systems:

*   **Cellular Backup:** Handles internet outages.
*   **Battery Backup:** Manages power failures.
*   **Redundant Camera Systems:** Ensures continuous monitoring.
*   **Local Video Storage:** Provides incident review capabilities.

### Testing Protocol:

*   **Functional Testing:** Verifies camera coverage, detection accuracy, and alert response time.
*   **Safety Testing:** Analyzes false positive rates and simulates emergency scenarios.
*   **User Acceptance Testing:** Involves family member training, mobile app usability, and alert preference configuration.
